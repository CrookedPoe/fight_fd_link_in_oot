# fight_fd_link_in_oot

This will port Fierce Deity Link's object to Ocarina of Time, and modify a copy of Dark Link's actor to use it. The new actor number is 0x0031 and the new object number is 0x003A. A map will need to be modified to use this actor. This can be applied to any clean Debug ROM.

The patch is a .txt file which can be applied to your ROM with CloudMax's [Rom Patcher](https://cloudmodding.com/app/rompatcher).
